It shows detailed how habits are formed and presents good arguments and shows great examples how to implement strategies, too. It also does a great job in motivating you and shows you directions you could use to reach your personal potential. It summarizes quickly which methods work best for habit creation and destruction.</p><h2 id="1f3c8f76-b18c-4fad-b489-d26cd8a82a0f" class="">Who Should Read It? </h2><p id="766fcca4-aa50-4968-84fc-2608ec949f11" class="">Everyone who really wants to know what the basics of habit creation are and who wants more motivation towards the achievement of their goal. I really recommend this book to someone who hasn&#x27;t read much about this topic. It is very useful for all who are new to this and explains to you the most important things you need to know for being successful in what you do. For someone who already knows something about the topic, it can be a good reminder of the things that are important and can even teach you stuff you didn&#x27;t even consider.</p><h1 id="903edd67-66ad-403c-a5da-7aec53e4b8b6" class="">How the Book Changed Me </h1><p id="0fe541f0-dc04-45d8-aad8-6f405a327b92" class="">Personally, I already knew a lot about habits and cravings and had amassed some experience. Nonetheless, this book strengthened my knowledge and was very helpful by showing me different view points. It also served as a good reminder on the importance of work ethics and virtue.</p><h1 id="a159e86d-ad01-44ac-8963-6c4638e07c2c" class="">My Top Quotes</h1><ul id="a15f81ee-52da-48f0-beb3-e53e8e77fc3c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">&quot;Habits ... are not about having something.

This is due to the compound effect.</p><p id="1fa5271f-1528-41b2-8ede-6f9daa5dd325" class="">It&#x27;s easy to dismiss tiny changes: &quot;If you procrastinate, there&#x27;s still tomorrow.&quot;, &quot;If you eat unhealthy one day, well there are still many other days, it won&#x27;t matter much.&quot; or: &quot;I studied Chinese for 1 hour today, I&#x27;m as bad as I am before.&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve worked so on this, I&#x27;m still bad.&quot;</p><p id="b380556b-75c4-4722-99b6-762a96a50765" class="">These tiny changes are what make you successful or fail miserably. Not sudden transformations. It&#x27;s about the consistent but small movement towards something, therefore small things need to be regarded as big considering their magnitude over time.</p><p id="4a2a7684-aa4b-4dd6-b937-f1089c559fcb" class="">It takes a long time until small changes accumulate. It&#x27;s like pressure that&#x27;s slowly building up and suddenly it&#x27;s released in a burst.  People only see the sudden burst of success but forget that successful people have worked very hard and for a long time <strong>without seeing a lot of results</strong>. This led them to their success.</p><p id="984e9974-0e68-4b99-8043-80c0218fc69e" class="">Don&#x27;t focus to much about goals. While they are useful, often they can cause some problems.</p><ul id="d554c5cf-306b-41ac-9680-e6a2bcb1f700" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Winners and losers have the same goals, what makes the difference is their system or way to progress towards their goal.</li></ul><ul id="1f968ca6-6721-4423-b568-14aa371893e4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">If you only want to reach goals but don&#x27;t change your habits or systems, you will certainly lose the achievement you gained.

Often in life there are many changes and often goals change. Rather you should start enjoying the process and stop thinking of only being able to relax after you reach your goal.
              <mark class="highlight-red">My own thought on this: </mark>The fulfillment of the goal itself won&#x27;t lead to happiness but the constant improvement and seeing yourself transform.</li></ul><ul id="ee619d45-4fb5-4bf0-901e-95e3f18de6dd" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Goals aren&#x27;t a good strategy for long-term success. Once you reach them, you fall back into bad habits. It&#x27;s not about a single accomplishment when you want to improve for a life time. It&#x27;s about keeping going and still using your system or process towards success.</li></ul><h3 id="f361cf63-b5ba-4c84-a31f-29e3147d13d0" class="">Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and vice versa)</h3><p id="eb9c59fc-ee95-4499-ae40-590d4c8ec219" class="">The reason for not being able to stick to your habits is that most people tend to try to implement change in the wrong way. They want to change by changing their results. But to change you need to change your identity, who you think you are. Identity comes first, the second layer is the process you implement and the third are the results. Change from the deepest layer will result in a easer habit formation.</p><p id="1e470fe8-c5e4-4372-8bc7-d14ffddc3864" class="">Believes are the principal reason for stagnation and staying the same way.</p><p id="07f0496e-65c5-4621-8680-f3035bf775c2" class="">To improve constantly you need to change constantly.</p><p id="5aaa7e7b-8f57-4d58-ad42-9de6ca276640" class="">&quot;Habits ... are not about having something.

This is called the <strong>Diderot-Effect</strong>. Use the momentum of finishing a habit. It&#x27;s often that we execute a strain of habits. Therefore, you should do a habit immediately after a certain habit you already do. But if you would like to perform your new habit daily, don&#x27;t add it to a habit you just perform weakly.

Later he began to associate performing his pre-workouts with feeling focused and competitive because he played the game later. Therefore he had created a ritual that gave him this focused feeling even when he isn&#x27;t in the mood, it primes him to feel a certain way. If you have a task accompanied by a feeling, you start to begin to feel that way by performing the task alone. For Instance, if you put in your earphones and listen to music to focus, you will start to be focused by just putting in the headphones without playing the music. You don&#x27;t need the thing responsible for it anymore, you feel a certain way without its original cause.

One failure is much worse than many winning. If you have 100 dollars and get 50, you&#x27;ve made 50% gain. Now you only need to lose 33% to be back at 100. It needs less negative impacts to decrease a bigger positive progress. Therefore, always stick to it, even if you feel bad that day. Doing something is better than doing nothing.</p><h3 id="b1d0af8c-aea5-4428-8301-474cbc892352" class="">Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything</h3><p id="ef459d99-0b72-47c4-9228-52a19f9eb0b5" class="">To break bad habits the reward of doing them must be directly linked to a punishment to stop the reward-cycle.</p><p id="b1c397b2-b059-4277-97eb-44c3b0eba547" class=""><strong>The cost of failing needs to be higher than the benefits of doing the habit.</strong></p><p id="d98ad057-1a85-419b-bded-8057efa6903c" class="">One way you can do this, is by signing a contract with an accountability partner.
